# Mine (Almost) Everything

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 26.3 that lets you mine normally unbreakable blocks with a netherite pickaxe.

## What it does

- A **netherite pickaxe** held in your main hand can mine these blocks:
  - **Bedrock**
  - **Reinforced deepslate**
- Only the netherite pickaxe gets these rules. Reinforced deepslate can still be broken slowly
  with other tools like in vanilla, but then it drops nothing.
- A block mined with a netherite pickaxe **drops as itself**, so you can pick it up and place it again.
- This works on **all bedrock**, including the bottom layer of the Overworld (y = −64).
  Careful: breaking that layer opens a hole into the void.

## Data-driven rules

Which blocks get the netherite rules is decided by data files, not by code:

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `data/mineeverything/tags/block/netherite_mineable.json` | The blocks the netherite pickaxe can mine with the rules below. |
| `data/minecraft/loot_table/blocks/<block>.json` | What each block drops. |

A datapack can add more blocks to the `mineeverything:netherite_mineable` tag.
Give each new block a loot table too, or it will drop nothing.

## Mining time

Mining one of these blocks takes **2 minutes** with no upgrades.

| Bonus | Effect on mining time |
| --- | --- |
| Efficiency enchantment | −15 seconds per level |
| Haste effect | −20 seconds per level |
| Minimum time | never less than 5 seconds |

Formula: `time = 120 − 15 × Efficiency level − 20 × Haste level` seconds, but at least 5 seconds.

Examples:

| Pickaxe and effects | Time |
| --- | --- |
| No enchantments, no Haste | 120 s |
| Efficiency V | 45 s |
| Haste II (e.g. from a beacon) | 80 s |
| Efficiency V + Haste I | 25 s |
| Efficiency V + Haste II | 5 s |

The time is fixed by these rules only. Unlike normal blocks, mining these blocks is **not** slowed down
by Mining Fatigue, being underwater or not standing on the ground.

## Durability

- Each of these blocks costs the pickaxe **10 durability** instead of the usual 1.
- **Unbreaking works as normal**: it is rolled separately for each of the 10 points.
  On average a block costs about 5 durability with Unbreaking I, 3.3 with Unbreaking II
  and 2.5 with Unbreaking III.
- The pickaxe can break while mining, just like any other tool.

## Creative mode

In Creative mode these blocks are broken instantly as usual. They do not drop as items,
and the pickaxe takes no damage.

## Requirements

| Software | Version |
